# Simply Budget.
## Concept
We wanted to create a budgeting app that stores user data online and can be accessed anywhere. It would also be user friendly and easy to read. Users can create an account, add transactions and budgets and keep track of their spending month to month. This app was created as a part of the DigitalCrafts 26 week Flex full stack program. 
## Project Requirements

- Your project must be a full stack application.
  - It must contain code that runs on the server (Node.js)
  - And the browser (client-side JavaScript)

- You must use a database to store and retrieve data.
  - Example: a user submits a form that is stored in a database
  - Another example: storing or retrieving sensor data that comes from a Raspberry Pi
  - You may use any database for this project: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Firebase, etc.
  - The database does not have to be hosted locally (ie: Firebase)

- Your project must be deployed somewhere publicly accessible.
  - [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
  - [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/)
  - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs)
  - [A2 Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/nodejs-hosting)
  - etc

- Your HTML must be defined in some sort of composable structure.
  - Example: React.js components
  - "render functions" that return HTML strings
  - Mustache templates
  - etc

- You must use at least one AJAX request to communicate to a back end API endpoint.
  - Or try out [WebSockets](https://socket.io/) for real-time communication

- The visual design of your application must be cohesive.
  - This can mean all custom CSS and design work
  - Or embracing a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma
  - Remember that your application is going to be "on stage" for demo day: first impressions matter!
  - Reach out to the staff if you need help or design review. We want to make you look good :-)

- Your code must be organized using JavaScript modules.
  - No super long files
  - No "spaghetti code"
  - Hint: `create-react-app` makes this easy for the front end
